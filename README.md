### ABSTRACT

In this exploration, we aimed to predict a team’s defense/special team’s fantasy performance using statistics from their previous season. To do so, we used data from FantasyDataPros containing regular season NFL data from 2002-2019 as well as some feature engineered variables to train several machine learning models such as linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting models. Our best model, a linear regression model, with a regular parameter of 0.25, a net parameter of 0.8, and 10 iterations, yielded an MSE of 14098 and correctly predicted 4 of the top 10 defense/special team (D/ST) units in the 2019 NFL season. Given that the model outperformed several competitor predictions, we deem our model to be usable and our objective a success.  Furthermore, by comparing the predictions of all the models we identified the Buffalo Bills, Minnesota Vikings, and Baltimore Ravens as our top defensive choices for the 2019 season. According to FantasyPros.com, all three teams were top ten defenses in 2019.
